# Java-Fundamentals-Assignment-in-inheritance

## Description
This is a set of exercises that test my knowledge in Java OOP concepts, it includes Java Classes and Objects, POJO, Interfaces and Inheritance

### Exercise 1
#### Tasks

1.	Implement a base class Account with the following fields owner:String, balance:Double, numberOfTransactions:int

2.	Provide suitable constructor(s), the methods withdraw and deposit.

3.	Write a tester method that uses all the methods of the class and displays suitable messages

4. Implement a subclass StoreAccount, using as base the Account class with the following extra fields

    storeName:String, accountCategory:string
    
5. Provide suitable constructor(s), the methods withdraw and deposit, changeCategory

6. Write a tester method that uses all the methods of the class
and displays suitable messages

##### Note: categories are basic, mid,  extra, premium.

### Exercise 2

1. Define a POJO class Product with the following field

   id: int , name:string , priceWhenBuy:double, priceWhenSell:double

2. Create an interface for the Store called IStore signatures of desired methods

   buy(Product), sell(Product), getRevenue():double
   
3. Create an implementation of IStore named SimpleRetailStore
  is a store that keeps no Inventory. Fields:
  totalBuyBalance:double, totalSellBalance :double
   
 Create the suitable methods so that main method in the Main class will be the following:  
 Product x1 = new Product(1, "Painting Picasso. Guernica", 100, 1000);
 
 Product x2 = new Product(2, "Painting Tsarouxis. Naftis A", 200, 2000);
 
 Product x4 = new Product(3, "Chair. Luis XV", 100, 1000);
 
 IStore simple= new SimpleRetailStore();
 
 simple.buy(x1);
 
 simple.buy(x4);
 
 simple.sell(x1);
 
 System.out.println(simple.getRevenue());
 
 4. Create another implementations of IStore named InventoryRetailStore is a
    store that has detailed Inventory. The event buy adds to Inventory and sell removes from Inventory
    
Fields: List<Product>

Methods: getInventory(), reset()

Create the suitable methods so that main method in the Main class will be the following:

Product x1 = new Product(1, "Painting Picasso. Guernica", 100, 1000);

Product x2 = new Product(2, "Painting Tsarouxis. Naftis A", 200, 2000);

Product x4 = new Product(3, "Chair. Luis XV", 100, 1000);

IStore invStore = new InventoryRetailStore();
 
invStore.buy(x1);

invStore.buy(x4);

nvStore.sell(x1);

System.out.println(invStore.getRevenue());

invStore.sell(x2);

invStore.getInventory();
